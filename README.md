## Tiny Things

This [Mindustry](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/) mod adds smaller versions of various buildings.

Some are perfectly functional, some might seem like a joke gone too far.

This mod was made for and tested on v7 alpha (136.1).

### Block list

- **Core: Sprout**  
  A small, cheap, low-capacity core.  
  Using it for campaign without extending capacity can be an interesting challenge.
- **Tiny Container**  
  1x1, 50 items, made from copper and lead instead of titanium.
- **Tiny RTG**  
  This one's pretty much just a quarter of a regular RTG but I found it very amusing to make a block that consumes 1 item _per minute_.
- **Tiny Surge Smelter**  
  At ~1/8 cost and input/output rate, can produce enough surge alloy for an occasional Surge Tower.  
  At 4 inputs and 1 output on a 1x1 block, it is also an exercise in connecting more than one conveyor per block side.
- **Tiny Hydro Drill**  
  This little drill can mine Thorium slightly less efficiently than a Laser Drill and without power, but requires water to operate. 
- **Tiny Meltdown**  
  In a way demonstrates how much you can simplify a sprite while still having it somewhat recognizable.  
  Not particularly well-tested/balanced as of writing this.
